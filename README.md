# Image Captioning with Conditioned LSTM Generators

Repo for HW5 - NLP Summer 2022 @ Columbia University

## Overview

This project is consists of the following components:

- Create matrices of image representations using an off-the-shelf image encoder.
- Read and preprocess the image captions.
- Write a generator function that returns one training instance (input/output sequence pair) at a time.
- Train an LSTM language generator on the caption data.
- Write a decoder function for the language generator.
- Add the image input to write an LSTM caption generator.
- Implement beam search for the image caption generator.
